### Why this repository?
**This is the second assignment for "Web development introduction" module.**
The assignment requirement is: _"Develop a static webpage with HTML and CSS and insert a link to another view"_.
This time I respected the assignment guidelines, but since it is just a task, I decided to add some upgrades, _just a little bit_.

## How did I do it?
I thought I would do following exactly the guidelines and the design, but I thought 
_"this is horrible and so simple... well, I'll add some extra stuff"_. 
At the end the final result is rather different than the original one, but it is much better.

-- Original version --

This time I tried to follow good practices and methodologies as BEM and a simple structure ordered by file types and modules.
